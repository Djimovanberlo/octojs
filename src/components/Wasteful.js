        Overall info:  Producing just one hamburger uses enough 
        fossil fuel to drive a small car 20 miles. 
        Of all raw materials and fossil fuels used in the U.S., 
        more than one-third are devoted to raising animals for food.

        More than 80 percent of the corn we grow and more than 
        95 percent of the oats are fed to livestock. 
        The world’s cattle alone consume a quantity of food 
        equal to the caloric needs of 8.7 
        billion people—more than the entire human population on Earth. 
        According to the Worldwatch Institute, “Roughly 2 of every 
        5 tons of grain produced in the world is fed to livestock, 
        poultry, or fish; decreasing consumption of these products, 
        especially of beef, could free up massive quantities 
        of grain and reduce pressure on land.”

        <li style={{ padding: "1em" }}>
        Given that the climate impact of plant-based foods is typically 
        10 to 50 times smaller than that of animal products, it follows 
        that switching from a largely meat-based diet to a vegetarian or 
        vegan diet could help to reduce emissions.

        <li style={{ padding: "1em" }}>
        A taste for meat has had a particular impact on land. 
        The mass of animals raised for slaughter on Earth now 
        outweighs wildlife by a factor of 15-to-1. For example, 
        for every person on the planet, there are approximately 
        three chickens.

        From cell phones to bicycle helmets to IV bags, 
        plastic has molded society in ways that make 
        life easier and safer. But the synthetic material 
        also has left harmful imprints on the environment 
        and perhaps human health.

        There are tiny pieces of plastic in many personal care and cosmetic 
        products such as sun cream and lipstick. These microplastics 
        are so small that we cannot see them with the naked eye. 
        Through our shower and sinks, they flow into sewage 
        systems, slip through the filters in water treatment 
        plants and reach our rivers and oceans. Once there, 
        they become a part of the plastic soup. 
        Marine animals mistake these microplastics for food. 
        These particles also end up on our plates because 
        we are part of the food chain.

        The Plastic Soup Foundation just released the free Beat 
        the Microbead app today which reads the ingredient lists
         on the packaging and recognizes more than 500 different
          types of microplastics. The user can immediately see 
          whether the scanned product contains microplastics and, 
          if so, which

        Cars consume a lot of energy before they ever make it to the open road. 
        Automotive production leaves a giant footprint because materials like 
        steel, rubber, glass, plastics, paints, and many more must be 
        created before a new ride is ready to roll.
